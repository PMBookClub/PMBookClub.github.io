          <h3>Growth Hacker Marketing</h3>

          <!-- BOOK AUTHOR -->
          <h4>by Ryan Holiday</h4>

          <!-- TODO: BOOK SHORT DESCRIPTION -->
          <p>
            In this remarkably brief book, Ryan Holiday outlines a new strategy for growing products: building virality into the product instead of plowing money into expensive ad campaigns and launch parties. Holiday argues that by hyper-focusing on a core set of users, turning them into advocates for your product, and iterating with data, you can scale a product much more cheaply and effectively than with the normal marketing approach.

        <p>
          People won’t talk about your product for free. To make your product go viral, you have to give people a reason to spread the word, like by giving free stuff to people who refer friends or by setting up an invite-only scheme that makes users feel important and “in the know” when they send invites.

          <i>Growth Hacker Marketing</i> greatest strength and greatest weakness is how short it is, at just a few dozen pages. On the plus side, it’s a super-quick read and is dense with powerful insights about how to change your product development strategy — particularly from people coming from the marketing side who need to learn the new, internet-powered, data-driven ways of acquiring users.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the booklet barely goes into depth, with just a handful of paragraph-long case studies about clever growth hacks that startups used. I was impressed by Holiday’s powerful new paradigm within a couple more pages, but for the rest of the book, I was starving for some meaty analyses and strategies for thinking up growth hacks. I had some other smaller gripes with the book, too: there was a lot of filler and time spent in Holiday complimenting himself, and some of the now-irrelevant startups the book picks as examples — StumbleUpon, Mailbox, Zynga — show its age.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though, again, the book’s briefness saves it. If you have 30 minutes to spare and want to gain a new lens on product development, this book will be a great help. But a lot of the work — in thinking up growth hacks and putting them into practice — is left as an exercise to the reader. (Holiday does leave you with one very good, and very meta, growth hack at the end of the book: he offers free content — a “$58 value” — in exchange for your email address.)

          <i>Growth Hacker Marketing</i> is split into four chapters, each representing one “stage” of the growth-hacking process:  getting product-market fit, finding a growth hack, going viral, and optimizing with data. Holiday offers a few brief case studies about successful growth hacks some startups have found, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>How Hotmail went viral by putting “Get free email with Hotmail” in email signatures</li>
          <li>How Dropbox grew by offering people free storage if they invited friends</li>
          <li>How Reddit made hundreds of fake profiles to kickstart its messaging boards</li>
          <li>How Uber offered free rides at SXSW, a conference packed with people in its target market (young tech-lovers)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The book also has a short example of how Holiday used the growth-hacking process to grow a bestselling author’s next book. It’s an interesting example, though not very relevant to the kinds of projects a typical PM or startup founder will work on.

            Many of the concepts in <i>Growth Hacker Marketing</i> are well-known to practicing PMs: lean methodology, how to achieve product-market fit, and the importance of metrics and iteration. But current PMs and startup founders will still find value in the idea of building virality into the product — it’s something you’ll start chewing over and seeing everywhere after you read the book.
          </p>

          <p>
            The book is a better fit for folks coming to product management from the marketing or business side; it’s a great introduction to the mindset you’ll want to adopt as you join the tech industry.
